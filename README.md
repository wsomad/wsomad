<h1 align="left">Hi, I'm Haikal 👋🏽 🧑🏽‍💻</h1>

<p>
  I'm a software engineer who enjoys building things that are hopefully useful — and sometimes just for fun (or completely useless, but hey, I learned something 😆). It all started back in 2020 after finishing 
  high school, when I proudly put together a basic HTML skeleton that barely qualified as a website. 
  
  Since then, I've been learning everything I can get my hands on, mostly through free resources and late-night Googling (ChatGPT wasn't a thing back then). These days, I find myself enjoying work with ReactTS, 
  Spring Boot Java, and Flutter. That curiosity and interest has eventually helped me land my first job as a programmer at one of the Big Four companies in Malaysia.
